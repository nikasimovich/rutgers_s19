The are.na channel should be titled by the concept name, have a brief description of the direction and how it relates to the project, a few visual references that bring the idea to life, and a couple examples of how you&rsquo;ll depict your Maxims online. Begin programming your website. We will work on this in class next week and it will be due on 03/07.
