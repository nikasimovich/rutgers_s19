### Homework
- Create 3 different concepts for your Maxims project. Create 3 are.na channels – one for each concept and link them under the parent directory that you already started. Each direction should include a title, visual references, experimentation in how the maxims will be depicted, and a basic wireframe showing how a user will navigate through the page. Have as much variety between the three directions as possible.
- Continue to refine your student homepage. Based on today&rsquo;s feedback, spend an hour revising it.
