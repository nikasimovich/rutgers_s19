### Homework
- Finish BOTH your class portfolio and the Pick 10 exercise. I&rsquo;d like to begin with a critique next week. In both projects â€“ be sure to have something you feel is a complete thought or exploration online. Be sure to have considered a navigationn, ann overarching concept, as well as a title of your site. Have reasons for your decisions!
- Find a source of text for your Maxims activity. Create an [are.na](https://www.are.na/) channel that houses the content. Link to your are.na on your class homepage.
