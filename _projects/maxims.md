### Overview

By definition, maxims are a short, pithy statement expressing a general truth or rule of conduct. For this project, collect a set of phrases from an existing source. Examples: Email subject lines, news headlines, dates, fortune cookie messages. Create a type-only website that displays these maxims in a compelling way. Consider the content of your maxims. What are they about and where are they coming from? How does the content change based on the hierarchy of your design and the way youâ€™re breaking it up? You should have at least 15 different maxims on your website and your website should guide the user with control and interest.

## Phase 2

After creating a functional first version of your project, let&rsquo;s see how programming can help create a narrative. Take the original contents of your maxims and find a way to use programming to change the way it&rsquo;s read.
