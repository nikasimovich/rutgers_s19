### Overview
In many aspects of design, humans respond positively to depictions of nature. For example, in motion, something that has a seamless loop “feels” better than something that’s choppy. For this reason, designers frequently reference the world around us to create things that feel natural and pleasing. Aside from motion, how can we take the natural world and bring it online? Additionally, how can we take references from the world around us and use it in a poetic way rather than being very literal. For this assignment, I’d like you to choose an object that exists in the world (it can be man made or natural) and depict it two ways: literally and in an abstract fashion.

For the literal version – create a website that simulates the object in the way you think of when you close your eyes.

For the abstract version – consider how to take inspiration from something without making it look exactly like the object. Create a website highlighting your favorite features of the object.

After completing both, consider which produces a more unexpected result. Evaluate what worked better in each.
