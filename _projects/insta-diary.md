### Instructions

1. Create an instagram account just for this class and post to it 5 times a week.
2. Every so often we’ll go through it and consider if there are any common threads emerging.
3. I’ll also ask you to refer back to your diary when you’re stuck, or when you’re beginning a project.
4. All photos should be taken by you and be taken during that week (example: you can't just post something you found on the internet)
5. Be sure to link to your instagram diary on your class homepage
