### Overview

For this class, please create a personal homepage that will house all of your assignments for this class. By the end of the class, you should have a functional log of everything you did in this class, as well as any additional content you might find relevant (for example: a personal bio, links to your other projects, experiments). Create a system of organizing your work – how will you group the projects and exercises? What kind of navigation is necessary for a user to quickly gain what they’ll look for? How does the content influence the design decisions?

### Deadlines

We will check this project incrementally. There will be 3 major check ins (In two weeks, at the midterm, and at the end of the semester)
