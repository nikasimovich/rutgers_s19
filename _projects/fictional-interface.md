### Overview

Working in pairs, develop a program that connects your environment to the screen.
We'll use the arduino as a controller and processing as a tool to visualize our inputs.
You can  send data from processing to arduino, or vice versa, using a sensor or series of sensors.
Use your imagination and play around with different sensors. We&rsquo;ll treat this activity as an experiment, but the interface and visualization should be informed by your interests in art and design.
The resulting screen display can be visual, text, or sound based.

Once you develop your app, each team member will create their own companion website documenting the result, the code and the process.
You can think of the companion website as a case study of your work on the project. Include a description on the goal of the project, any art historical references you were exploring, as well as a video of the program in use. Consider how else to document the project (with photos, illustrations, animations etc). Display your code and include a description on how it affected the final outcome. Consider formal design themes on how you to organize your work and create interest about it.
