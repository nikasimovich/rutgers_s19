### Overview
- Unlike print design, digital design evolves and exists in multiple contexts.
- For this assignment, I&rsquo;d like you to create a poster generator that creates a variety of different results when you run it.
- Think about an overarching idea for your generator. What kind of parameters will be in place to define the results? How much variation are you hoping to achieve? Will you create a mathematical compositiol? How will the generator change? On it&rsquo;s own with time, a new result everytime you refresh the page, with the mouse, by clicking on it, with sound, with your face??
- Once you create your generator, create a series of 6 posters from it. Your posters can be exported using screenshots or a print library.
- All of your posters should be the same size. They can either be squares or follow a standard poster proportion.
- Create a website that houses a gallery of the six posters as well as a link to the generator. All parts of the project should feel consistent with one another.
