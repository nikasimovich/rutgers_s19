### Create a GitHub account and repository

1. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account using your newschool username and email.
  - If you already have a GitHub account and repository under your newschool username rename the old repository to something else, for example `fisherdm.github.io.2018`.
1. [Create a new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) named `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`, e.g. `fisherdm.github.io`

### Set up your working repository

#### Clone your repository

```bash
cd ~                       # change directory to home directory
git clone YOUR_REPO_PATH   # clone the new repo you created on GitHub e.g. git clone git@github.com:fisherdm/fisherdm.github.io.git
cd fisherdm.github.io      # change directory into the repo you just cloned
```

#### Upload your changes to the GitHub server

1. Create a file in your `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io` directory named `index.html`
2. Use git to add this file and commit the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .                    # tell git you want to add all files
git commit -m 'first commit' # commit these files with a message
git push                     # push these files to GitHub, the remote server
```
